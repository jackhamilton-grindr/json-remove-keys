Removes any keys which are a case-sensitive match to any key at any level from a provided json file.

Syntax:
json-remove-keys [filepath] [key] [another key] [etc]

As usual, keys should be placed in quotes if they contain spaces to avoid them being interpreted as two separate keys.


WARNING:
Will write over the file.
